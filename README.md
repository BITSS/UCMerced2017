## Materials for the February 2017 Reproducibility Training , UC Merced

### Installation Instructions
The workshop will *briefly* introduce you to tools that can help you make your workflow more reproducible. You may want to install [the following software programs](http://www.bitss.org/2016/01/08/open-source-software-for-reproducible-social-science/)  before coming to the workshop, but we don't have enough time for a full hands-on experience.

### Workshop Materials
The numbered files/directories will take you through the workshop in order.

1-Intro features a set of slides (Beamer/LaTeX slides rendered as PDF) that discuss the reproducibility crisis in the social sciences.

2-Tools-Intro is a set of slides covering the software tools we'll discuss.
